# What?
As part of a 5-man team, we analysed a dataset of company employees to detmine the aspects of their work that most contributed to them leaving the business. We each picked a machine learning algorithm, and used it to conduct this research, ending the project by comparing our models with each other.

# Why?
While a good portion of our time learning AI was spent creating predictive models, we had yet to actually apply our knowledge to a practical use-case. This project was created in an effort to make our work useful, and to show how predictive Artifical Intelligence models can be used to benefit businesses.

# How?
This project was written in R. We each picked a machine learning algorithm and conducted our experiements on the same dataset, compiling a report on our findings to conclude the project.
