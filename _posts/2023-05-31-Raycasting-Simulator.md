# What?
A 'robot' that makes its way through a ragged tunnel using raycasting to 'see'.

# Why?
While a good portion of our degree was dedicated to Web Development, we were taught very little JavaScript. As a major focus of our studies were Artifical Intelligence, we (a team of three) decided to create a JavaScript program as an application of our existing Machine Learning knowledge.

# How?
There isn't much to this project but a few JavaScript files, but feel free to check out the code using the link below.
