# What?
The project was conducted as part of a second year assignment to navigate a software engineering setting, and required coordination between a team of six, computer science students. As such, the main objective was to work effectively with each other, and to test our knowledge of software engineering standards, for example in the fields of planning and lifecycles.

# Why?
The goal of the website was to encourage a deeper connection between people and nature. By providing a platform to record and share wildlife sightings, the website also contributes valuable data which can be beneficial for environmental researchers and conservationists tracking wildlife patterns and biodiversity in specific regions.

Regularly-scheduled meetings and code review sessions allowed us to resolve issues quickly, maintain project cohesion, and stay aligned with objectives. Through the collaborative environment of the project, we also developed practical skills in version control and agile project management.

# How?
The project was developed collaboratively by a team of six using the Django web framework, where I acted as Project Lead. Django was selected for its robust support for building data-driven web applications and compatibility with various front and back-end components, making it ideal for a project requiring user authentication, data storage, and content management.
